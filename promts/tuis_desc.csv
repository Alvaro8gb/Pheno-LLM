T048,Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction,A clinically significant dysfunction whose major manifestation is behavioral or psychological. These dysfunctions may have identified or presumed biological etiologies or manifestations.
T049,Cell or Molecular Dysfunction,"A pathologic function inherent to cells, parts of cells, or molecules."
T050,Experimental Model of Disease,A representation in a non-human organism of a human disease for the purpose of research into its mechanism or treatment.
T059,Laboratory Procedure,"A procedure, method, or technique used to determine the composition, quantity, or concentration of a specimen, and which is carried out in a clinical laboratory. Included here are procedures which measure the times and rates of reactions."
T060,Diagnostic Procedure,"A procedure, method, or technique used to determine the nature or identity of a disease or disorder. This excludes procedures which are primarily carried out on specimens in a laboratory."
T184,Sign or Symptom,"An observable manifestation of a disease or condition based on clinical judgment, or a manifestation of a disease or condition which is experienced by the patient and reported as a subjective observation."
T190,Anatomical Abnormality,"An abnormal structure, or one that is abnormal in size or location."
